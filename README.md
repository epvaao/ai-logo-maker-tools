## FAQ

**Can AI logo makers create designs suitable for trademark registration?**

AI-generated logos work fine for trademark applications if they meet uniqueness standards—the key is customizing generated designs enough to distinguish them from existing marks. Most platforms like Logome, Looka, and Brandmark allow extensive editing of fonts, colors, icons, and layouts to ensure your final logo is sufficiently distinctive. Download vector files (SVG or EPS formats) from your chosen platform since trademark offices prefer scalable formats that maintain quality at any size.

**How do these platforms compare for businesses needing bilingual or international branding?**

Platforms like Canva and Adobe Express excel at multilingual logos because they offer extensive font libraries supporting various character sets and international typography styles. Logome and Looka automatically generate brand kits that maintain visual consistency across different language versions, which is crucial for businesses operating in multiple markets. When creating international logos, prioritize platforms that provide vector files so you can easily scale and adapt text elements for different regional applications.

**What's the quickest way to test if a logo works across digital and print media?**

Use platforms like Looka or Wix that automatically generate mockups showing your logo on business cards, signage, websites, and merchandise before you finalize. Download your logo in multiple formats—PNG for digital screens, SVG/EPS for print materials—and test visibility at various sizes from small mobile icons to large banner displays. The best logos remain recognizable whether displayed as a tiny favicon or printed on a billboard, so verify legibility at both extremes before committing.
